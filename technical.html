                    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.It is a standard markup language used to design the documents displayed in the browsers as a web page. This language can
                    become more interactive and attractive by using CSS ( Cascading Style Sheet) and JS (JavaScript) within it.</p>
                    <p>The HTML word defines some specific meaning within it. Hypertext comes from the Hyperlink which means connections
                    between several pages, Markup means the defined elements will be the page layout and elements within the page. The
                    language combines both the feature and makes it Hypertext Markup Language.HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup
                    language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.</p>
                    <p>Initially, the HTML was released in the year of 1993 and developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. Currently, the Web
                    Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) community working on the development of the HTML. The current
                    HTML5 version has gained so much popularity because of its newly added features in it. All the website’s skeleton is
                    made of HTML and each browser performs on that and makes that visible and user-friendly to the user.</p>

                    <p>HTML is used to create the structure of web pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web (www). It contains Tags and
                    Attributes that are used to design the web pages. Also, we can link multiple pages using Hyperlinks.</p>

                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong><p>This language is so much flexible that you can create whatever you want, a flexible way to design web pages along with
                        the text.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Linkable:</strong><p>You can make linkable text like users can connect from one page to another page or website through these
                        characteristics.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Limitless features:</strong><p>You can add videos, GIFs, pictures, or sound anything you want that will make the website more attractive and

                        program any logic but to give structure and semantically meaning to our website. Though we can link JavaScript code to
                        it which is a programming language.</p></li>
                        <li><strong>Language Support:</strong><p>HTML can support various other languages like JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Perl, and many more. You can also able to run embed
